# version-control
This project is to get more familiar with version control basics.

Included in this project are both addition and division functions located in "math_lib.py"

The "add" and "div" function is used in "calculate.py"

A shell executable fille titled "run.sh" executes "calculate.py" to demonstrate usage of the "math_lib.py" functions
